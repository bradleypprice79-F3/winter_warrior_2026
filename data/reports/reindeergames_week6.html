<h1>Week 6 – What’s Next?</h1>
<h2>The Obstacles to Acceleration</h2>

<div class="section">
    <p>Over the past 5 weeks, we’ve covered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>QSource Overview</strong> – What QSource is and why it’s useful</li>
        <li><strong>Get Right</strong> – Put your own mask on first so you can help others</li>
        <li><strong>Live Right</strong> – Be in proper relationship with others; help them with their mask</li>
        <li><strong>Lead Right</strong> – Develop the skills and virtues to influence movement to advantage</li>
        <li><strong>Leave Right</strong> – Construct a legacy that outlasts you</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So for Week 6, we’re asking: <strong>What’s Next?</strong> (Thanks @Sparkler!)</p>
</div>
<hr style="border: 0; height: 2px; background-color: black;">
<div class="section">
    <h2>Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>
    <p><strong>Acceleration, of course!</strong></p>

    <p>But… what does acceleration actually look like?</p>

    <h3>Reindeer Games is DUMB!</h3>
    <p>Ok, maybe. I guess no one should be going to this many workouts every week!</p>

    <p>And after ECing every day and going to multiple workouts daily, perhaps acceleration might not mean running even more miles and posting at even more workouts!  How could it??</p>
    <p>Some of us have been a bit crazy during RDG and many men have been participating in F3 in a cadence that is just not sustainable for daily life.  I don’t think that’s really a problem though.  In the same way that fasting can be a great thing to do for a period of time, it is also not sustainable for daily life.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you pushed yourself during RDG, GREAT!</li>
        <li>If you didn't, ok. I think you missed out of course, but ok.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Either way: <strong>What’s next?</strong></p>

    <p>How will you continue to accelerate now that RDG is drawing to a close?</p>

    <p>Perhaps, during RDG, you discovered that you can actually do a little more than you thought, and it’s something that you CAN maintain.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you are going to be mindful about your sleep schedule and what you eat and drink.</p>

    <p>Spend some time thinking about this, maybe even journal about it.  Maybe start thinking about your goals for 2026.</p>
    <p><strong>No, seriously, like right now.</strong>  Spend some time thinking about it. How you will accelerate!?</p>

    <h2>The Obstacles to Acceleration</h2>
    <p>We’ve all seen it.  A guy is really accelerating in life.  And then, some time later, you see him again and he is just floating around sitting in his boat, oars just floating.  <strong>What happened???</strong></p>

    <p>Don’t just look at him and act judgmental. Ask yourself: <strong>What could derail my acceleration?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>1. Drift</h3>
    <p>A man who is <em>not purposeful</em> inevitably drifts. Drift is the natural state of a man with no direction.</p>

    <p><strong>Causes of Drift:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not taking the Daily Red Pill.  You have to show up!</li>
        <li>Losing continuity (no disciplines or routines)</li>
        <li>Lack of accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>“Man left to his own devices will drift. Purpose and accountability arrest the Drift.”</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>2. Isolation</h3>
    <p>“Man is made to be in community.” Isolation is one of the fastest ways to stall out.</p>

    <p>Isolation kills acceleration because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You cannot Live Right or Lead Right alone</li>
        <li>Without a Shield Lock, you are fragile under stress</li>
        <li>Blind spots grow</li>
        <li>Isolation increases fear, shame, and paralysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Recall that in the first week we heard from @ScubaSteve,<em>“Life has a way of isolating us.”</em> Be on guard against that Isolation!</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>3. Comfort</h3>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with comfort.  But men will stall when they <em>choose comfort over commitment.</em></p>

    <p>The Fartsack represents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Laziness</li>
        <li>Excuses</li>
        <li>The gravitational pull toward ease</li>
        <li>Avoiding discomfort and challenge</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>“The Comfort Zone is a cage disguised as a recliner.”</blockquote>

    <p>Know what your commitments are. Make them public to those who can hold you accountable.  And choose commitment over comfort.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>4. Fear</h3>
    <p>Fear is a universal inhibitor</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fear of failure, rejection, responsibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fear + comfort = the perfect recipe for stalling out.</p>
    The opposite of fear is Courage.
    <blockquote>“Courage is not the absence of fear, but being afraid and moving anyway.”</blockquote>

    <p>Additionally, the unknown is always scarier than the actual event.  Choose to be courageous.  Move forward into the water, even though you are afraid, and you will find that it’s never as bad as you thought it would be.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>5. Shame & Isolation Loops</h3>
    <p>The shame loop:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A man struggles</li>
        <li>He hides it</li>
        <li>He isolates</li>
        <li>The problem grows</li>
        <li>He’s less likely to reach out</li>
        <li>He quits accelerating</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Community, such as a Shield Lock and a whetstone, is the antidote.  Be vulnerable, communicate, and demand Candor (the telling of hard truths) from those around you.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure is part of the acceleration!</strong></p>
    <p>You were injured, you got new hours at work, things got busy, you had to travel, and so you were unable to come out for a while.  And it was easier just to stay home, even when you could have come back out. <strong>FAIL!</strong></p>
    <p>You had quit your bad habit, but now you have found yourself back in it, yet again. <strong>FAIL!</strong></p>
    <p>You applied for the new job, even had some great interviews, but they went a different direction. <strong>FAIL!</strong></p>
    <p>No worries, Failure is part of the process.  <em>Do not allow Isolation and Shame to take root!</em></p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>6. The Crack Pipe of the Status Quo</h3>
    <p>Leadership requires disrupting what is. The Status Quo resists change.</p>

    <p>A man stalls when he avoids conflict or disruption.</p>

    <blockquote>“The HIM disrupts what IS to accelerate what COULD BE.”</blockquote>

    <p>Routine can be a good thing, and we naturally resist change because we are afraid of the unknown.</p>

    <p>The Status Quo only thinks about WHAT IS and refuses to think about WHAT’S NEXT!?</p>
</div>
<hr>

<div class="section">
    <h2>What’s Next!?</h2>
    <p>You thought about it, right?</p>

    <p>Write it down. Share it with someone who will hold you accountable.  
    And stay alert to the obstacles.</p>

    <p><strong>Keep accelerating—one intentional choice at a time.</strong></p>
