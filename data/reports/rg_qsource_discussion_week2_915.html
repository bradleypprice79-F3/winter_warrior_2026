        <h2>Opening <span class="time">(5 min)</span></h2>
        <p class="note">Quick check-in and bridge from last week.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Last week, we talked about <strong>Get Right</strong>. Reminder: Get Right doesn’t mean live for yourself — it’s about proper personal alignment so you can Accelerate yourself.</li>
          <li>Ask: <em>What is one way you tried to get yourself Right this past week?</em></li>
          <li>Recall the airplane oxygen-mask example: put your mask on first so you can help those around you. Helping others is what the <strong>Live Right</strong> quadrant is all about.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Live Right — Core Passage</h2>
        <div class="quote">“Live Right is focused on the HIM’s IMPACT on the lives of other people and how he helps them to Accelerate.”</div>

        <div>
          <h2>Purpose and Advantage <span class="time">(10 min)</span></h2>
          <p><strong>Guide quote:</strong> “Purpose is an Advantage sought. To be Purposeful is to Commit oneself to bringing an Advantage into fruition.”</p>

          <div class="examples">
            <strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Advantage = a better circumstance you’re trying to create for a group.</em>
            <br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> At work, the Advantage might be a more supportive team culture that produces better outcomes and retention.
          </div>

          <ol>
            <li>Ask the group to describe a position of Advantage available for a group they are part of (F3, family, work, church, community).</li>
            <li>Follow-up: How are you, or how could you be, purposeful in that context?</li>
            <li>Ask: What does it look like to be committed to bringing this Advantage into fruition?</li>
          </ol>

        <div>
          <h2>Self‑Sacrifice <span class="time">(10 min)</span></h2>
          <p>Transition: Purpose requires giving something up to create value for others.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Ask: How do you feel about self‑sacrifice? Is this true?</li>
            <li>Why would self‑sacrifice be required to be committed to bringing an Advantage into fruition? Ask for examples.</li>
            <li>Read the guiding passage aloud (or paraphrase):</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="quote">“A man who has gotten Right is no longer expending most of his energy to merely survive. As his personal Guardrails increase in strength through the building of positive Habits, he finds himself gradually thinking less about his own Existential Continuity and more about what the SkyQ has planned for him and how he can be a Servant to those around him.”</div>

          <p class="note">Tie back to the oxygen mask analogy: putting on your mask so you can help others get theirs on.</p>
        </div>

      <section>
        <h2>The Sur‑Ser Continuum <span class="time">(10 min)</span></h2>
        <p class="note">Read these two lines to frame the continuum:</p>
        <div class="quote">“On the Survivor end of the Sur‑Ser Continuum are those men who can only stay alive by feeding off of their Community.”</div>
        <div class="quote">“On the Servant end of the Sur‑Ser Continuum are the Servants, those men who have gotten Right and now Live Right to the Advantage of their Groups while expecting nothing in return. These are the HIM in whose boats the Survivors are riding.”</div>

        <ol>
          <li>Where are you on the Survivor‑Servant Continuum? Which direction are you moving?</li>
          <li>Are you open to inviting Survivors to ride in YOUR boat?</li>
          <li>Whose boat are YOU riding in, or when have you ridden in someone’s boat?</li>
          <li>What do real‑life examples of “boat riding” look like? (Prompt with examples below)</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
          <li>Financial dependence</li>
          <li>Motivational dependence</li>
          <li>Leadership avoidance</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note"><strong>Facilitator reminder:</strong> Keep the tone non‑shaming; emphasize context and pathways forward for Survivors.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Living Right keeps you Right <span class="time">(5 min)</span></h2>
        <div class="quote">“The HIM is also a man who finds that in his effort to Live Right by carrying the Survivors and IMPACTing the Sad Clowns he gets an unexpected benefit–he himself is kept Right. It’s ironic, but having abandoned Existential Continuity in order to Serve, the HIM finds that he is kept personally aligned.”</div>
        <p>Ask: Is this true? How have you experienced this in your life? Encourage 2–3 quick stories.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Application / Commitments <span class="time">(Last 5 min)</span></h2>
        <p class="note">Choose one for the coming week and lock in an accountability partner before you leave.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify someone in your circle (work, church, family, F3) who could use support or encouragement and reach out with no expectation of return.</li>
          <li>Pick one habit or activity that eats up your time/energy selfishly; reduce or eliminate it to free up space for someone else.</li>
          <li>Reflect daily (5 minutes): "How did I live beyond myself today?" Write down one answer each day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><strong>Accountability:</strong> DM the guy next to you <strong>right now</strong> with your choice and hold each other accountable.</p>
