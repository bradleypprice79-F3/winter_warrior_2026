  <h1>Discussion Guide: Q1 – “Get Right”</h1>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> “A man must Get Right before he can do anything else.” — <em>F3 Nation</em></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Opening (5 minutes)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Welcome everyone</strong> and share the purpose: to engage with Q1 “Get Right,” exploring how we align ourselves personally so we can lead and serve others.</li>
      <li><strong>Quick icebreaker:</strong> Have each guy share <strong>one word</strong> that describes how he’s feeling right now about his own <strong>Fitness, Fellowship, or Faith</strong> (just one word).</li>
      <li><strong>Read the key paragraph together</strong> (either the rowing boat analogy or summary) to set the tone:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>“A man must Get Right before he can do anything else.”</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Get Right – What is “Right”? (10 minutes)</h2>
    <p>The chapter defines <em>RIGHT</em> as <strong>“the discipline and desire to consistently promote the cause of the below over his own cause.”</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>(Fitness)</em> His own body</li>
      <li><em>(Fellowship)</em> His loved ones</li>
      <li><em>(Faith)</em> His Creator</li>
    </ul>

```
<p><strong>Discussion Prompt:</strong><br>
What does “Right” look like in each of the following—Fitness, Fellowship, and Faith?  
One way of describing what something <em>is</em> is to describe what it <em>is not.</em> Feel free to use that method as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>(Fitness)</em> His own body</li>
  <li><em>(Fellowship)</em> His loved ones</li>
  <li><em>(Faith)</em> His Creator</li>
</ul>
```

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reflection / Personal Check-In (10 minutes)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Take <strong>2 minutes individually</strong> and jot down two things:
        <ol>
          <li>Where I’m doing okay in <strong>Fitness / Fellowship / Faith</strong></li>
          <li>One area where I’m <strong>not “Right” yet</strong> (e.g., lack of self-control, weak relationships, neglect of faith)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>After the silent time, go around and ask <strong>2–3 willing guys</strong> to share highlights—nothing too deep unless they choose to.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Discussion Questions (10 minutes)</h2>

```
<h3>Q1:</h3>
<blockquote>“An un-fit man is a slave to his lack of self-control.” — <em>F3 Nation</em></blockquote>
<p>What does that mean to you? In what ways might a lack of control in one area undermine your effectiveness in others (work, home, church)?</p>
<ul><li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> What is one habit you currently have (or struggle with) that reflects a lack of self-control?</li></ul>

<h3>Q2:</h3>
<blockquote>“To be able to help others, a man must first help himself.” — <em>F3 Nation</em></blockquote>
<p>How does this principle apply in your role (as husband, father, leader) and in your involvement with our group?</p>
<ul><li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> If you ignore your own “boat” (Fitness, Fellowship, Faith), who suffers? <span class="small">(Think of your “concentrica” — your family, your team, etc.)</span></li></ul>
```

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Additional Questions (if time allows)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is it possible to be so focused on <em>being fit</em> that one is <strong>not “Right”?</strong></li>
      <li>For example, can someone be so focused on RDG points that they miss the opportunity to <strong>Plant, Grow, Serve, and Invigorate male community leadership?</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Last 5 Minutes – Action & Accountability</h2>
    <h3>Q4:</h3>
    <p>Thinking practically, what is <strong>one concrete step</strong> you will take this week (or over the next month) to “Get Right” in one of the three areas (Fitness, Fellowship, Faith)?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask each guy to <strong>commit to one action.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Pair up</strong> with the guy or guys next to you and message them on Slack with your action.
        <ul>
          <li>If you don’t have one yet, message them that you don’t have one yet.</li>
          <li>Hold each other accountable to the action—or to first coming up with one.</li>
          <li>If you’re uncomfortable sharing, be as vague as needed. <em>“I’m going to do the thing”</em> is fine if that’s all you’ve got.</li>
          <li>It’s not ideal, but if that’s where you’re at, that’s okay.</li>
          <li>You know what it is—and they can encourage you to <strong>“do the thing.”</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>End with gratitude and encouragement.</strong><br>
    Remind everyone: <em>Getting Right is the foundation for living purposefully and leading well. Start with yourself—then go impact others.</em></p>
